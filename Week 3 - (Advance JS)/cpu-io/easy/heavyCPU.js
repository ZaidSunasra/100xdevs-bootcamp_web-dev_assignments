// Problem Description – Blocking CPU-Intensive Task
//
// You are given a function that performs a large number of calculations
// synchronously using a loop.
//
// Your task is to observe and understand how a CPU-heavy synchronous
// operation blocks the JavaScript event loop, preventing other code
// (such as timers or async callbacks) from running until it completes.

    let sum = 0;
    for(let i=0; i< iterations; i++){
        sum += i
    }
    return sum
